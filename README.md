## EARLY PREDICTION OF STUDENTâ€™S PERFORMANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION 
### PROJECT BY: TEAM GITHUB [HDSC spring '23]
## Introduction:
Obtaining a university degree is a formidable challenge faced by students worldwide. The process can be overwhelming as students adapt to a more demanding academic environment, deal with separation from family, and encounter other obstacles. These difficulties significantly impact academic performance, often leading to failure and dropout. Various factors, including financial hardships, contribute to high dropout rates, which not only frustrate students on a personal level but also have a detrimental effect on productivity and the community as a whole. To address this urgent issue, tertiary institutions have implemented counseling services, tutoring programs, workshops, and mentoring initiatives, striving to support students and improve their chances of success.
## Problem statement:

## Aims and Objective:
The central aim of this project is to investigate the optimal approach for accurately predicting students' academic performance and identifying their risk of dropout at the earliest stages of their higher education journey. Our objective is to develop a comprehensive system that facilitates the prompt segmentation of students from the beginning of their academic path. By doing so, we aim to establish a proactive framework that effectively addresses potential obstacles and provides timely support to at risk students.
