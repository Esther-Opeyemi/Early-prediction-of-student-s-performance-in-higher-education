## EARLY PREDICTION OF STUDENTâ€™S PERFORMANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION 
### PROJECT BY: TEAM GITHUB [HDSC spring '23]
## Introduction:
Obtaining an academic degree poses significant challenges for students worldwide. The process often appears daunting, as students must adapt to a more rigorous academic environment and cope with being away from their families, among other factors. These challenges have a critical impact on students' academic performance, frequently resulting in academic failure and, in many cases, dropout. Dropout rates are influenced by various reasons, including financial difficulties. On a personal level, academic failure can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among students. From a broader perspective, high dropout rates contribute to a decline in productivity and an uneducated workforce, which has a disastrous impact on the community. In recent times, addressing academic failures, including dropout rates, has become an urgent priority. Tertiary institutions have implemented various strategies to mitigate these issues, including the provision of counseling services, tutoring programs, workshops, and mentoring initiatives. Extensive efforts have been made in this domain to support students and enhance their chances of success.
## Problem statement:

## Aims and Objective:
The central aim of this project is to investigate the optimal approach for accurately predicting students' academic performance and identifying their risk of dropout at the earliest stages of their higher education journey. Our objective is to develop a comprehensive system that facilitates the prompt segmentation of students from the beginning of their academic path. By doing so, we aim to establish a proactive framework that effectively addresses potential obstacles and provides timely support to at risk students.
