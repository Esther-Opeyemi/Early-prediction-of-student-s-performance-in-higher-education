## Aims and Objective:
The central aim of this project is to investigate the optimal approach for accurately predicting students' academic performance and identifying their risk of dropout at the earliest stages of their higher education journey. Our objective is to develop a comprehensive system that facilitates the prompt segmentation of students from the beginning of their academic path. By doing so, we aim to establish a proactive framework that effectively addresses potential obstacles and provides timely support to at risk students.
