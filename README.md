## EARLY PREDICTION OF STUDENTâ€™S PERFORMANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION 
### PROJECT BY: TEAM GITHUB [HDSC spring '23]
## Introduction:
Obtaining a university degree is a formidable challenge faced by students worldwide. The process can be overwhelming as students adapt to a more demanding academic environment, deal with separation from family, and encounter other obstacles. These difficulties significantly impact academic performance, often leading to failure and dropout. Various factors, including financial hardships, contribute to high dropout rates, which not only frustrate students on a personal level but also have a detrimental effect on productivity and the community as a whole. To address this urgent issue, tertiary institutions have implemented counseling services, tutoring programs, workshops, and mentoring initiatives, striving to support students and improve their chances of success.
## Problem statement:

## Aims and Objective:
The central aim of this project is to investigate the optimal approach for accurately predicting students' academic performance and identifying their risk of dropout at the earliest stages of their higher education journey. Our objective is to develop a comprehensive system that facilitates the prompt segmentation of students from the beginning of their academic path. By doing so, we aim to establish a proactive framework that effectively addresses potential obstacles and provides timely support to at-risk students. 
 
## Data:
The dataset used for this project was created by a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the student's academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic success. The problem is formulated as a three-category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. The dataset has 4424 instances (Rows) and 36 attributes(Columns).
